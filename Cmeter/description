C-meter spawns virtual machines, or is given a number of virtual machines, which then uses to execute the jobs of the workload.

Given a job of the workload "x" it uses the ExecuteJob module to actually run the job on top of the virtual machine.
ExecuteJob downloads the binary file of the job to be executed from the KF Web Server located outside the cloud
 
 
ec2bd.py appears to be the central file, with which the execution of Cmeter starts.
